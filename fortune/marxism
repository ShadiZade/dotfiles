All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the 
interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, 
independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 
majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot 
stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of 
official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 

	1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they 
	point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, 
	independently of all nationality. 

	2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class 
	against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent 
	the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and 
resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which 
pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great 
mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, 
the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or 
principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be 
universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations 
springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going 
on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not 
at all a distinctive feature of communism.

The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, 
but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the 
final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, 
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: 
Abolition of private property.

We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally 
acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be 
the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, 
self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, 
a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; 
the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still 
destroying it daily.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person

You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, 
private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the 
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, 
with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the 
non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.

In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. 
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.

It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal

do not work.

But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard

Q:	How did the proletariat originate?

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)

[The] industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine, various spinning machines, 
the mechanical loom, and a whole series of other mechanical devices. These machines, which were very expensive 
and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former 
workers, because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with 
their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms. The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the 
big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers (tools, looms, etc). 
The result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers. 

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)

[...] Two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others. These are:

	1.	The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession 
		of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for 
		the production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or the bourgeoisie.

	2.	The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order 
		to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, 
		or the proletariat.

The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery 
and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
Q:	In what way do proletarians differ from serfs?
A:	The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up 
	a part of his product or part of the services of his labor. The proletarian works with the instruments of 
	production of another, for the account of this other, in exchange for a part of the product.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
The serf liberates himself in one of three ways: either he runs away to the city and there becomes a 
handicraftsman; or, instead of products and services, he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a 
free tenant; or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner. In short, by one 
route or another, he gets into the owning class and enters into competition. The proletarian liberates 
himself by abolishing competition, private property, and all class differences.

	suppressed [...] we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them 
	with words.

Q:	Will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke?

the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is resolved by the method of socialist revolution; 
the contradiction between the great masses of the people and the feudal system is resolved by the method of 
democratic revolution; the contradiction between the colonies and imperialism is resolved by the method of 
national revolutionary war; the contradiction between the working class and the peasant class in socialist 
society is resolved by the method of collectivization and mechanization in agriculture; contradiction within 
the Communist Party is resolved by the method of criticism and self-criticism; the contradiction between 
society and nature is resolved by the method of developing the productive forces. The principle of using 
different methods to resolve different contradictions is one that Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe.

[The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956] was a case of reactionaries inside a socialist country, 
in league with the imperialists, attempting to achieve their conspiratorial aims by taking advantage of contradictions 
among the people to foment dissension and stir up disorder. This lesson of the Hungarian events merits attention.

U.S. imperialism invaded China's territory of Taiwan and has occupied it for the past nine years. A short while ago 
it sent its armed forces to invade and occupy Lebanon. The United States has set up hundreds of military bases in

on foreign soil are so many nooses round the neck of U.S. imperialism. The nooses have been fashioned by the Americans 
themselves and by nobody else, and it is they themselves who have put these nooses round their own necks, handing the 
ends of the ropes to the Chinese people, the peoples of the Arab countries and all the peoples of the world who love

Imperialism will not last long because it always does evil things. It persists in grooming and supporting reactionaries

people of the world are rising or will rise in struggle against it. Yet, imperialism is still alive, still running 
amuck in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the West imperialism is still oppressing the people at home. This situation

Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the military, political, economic and natural conditions

In his endeavor to win a war, a military strategist cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the material conditions; 
within these limitations, however, he can and must strive for victory. The stage of action for a military strategist is

recover our lost territory by our own efforts, and the ability to stand on our own feet in the family of nations.

We stand for self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid but cannot be dependent on it; we depend on our own efforts, 
on the creative power of the whole army and the entire people.

We must thoroughly clear away all ideas among our cadres of winning easy victories through good luck,

The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants and working intellectuals. If they take their destiny 
into their own hands, follow a Marxist-Leninist line and take an active attitude in solving problems instead of 
evading them, there will be no difficulty in the world which they cannot overcome.

It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is all plain sailing and easy success, without difficulties 
and setbacks or the exertion of tremendous efforts.

Marxist philosophy holds that the most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective 
world and thus being able to explain it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world.

Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. 
They come from social practice and from it alone.

We are Marxists, and Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective facts, 
not from abstract definitions, and that we should derive our guiding principles, policies and measures from an 
analysis of these facts.

Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they 
like without basing it on objective reality or having it tested against reality. Materialism and dialectics, 
on the other hand, need effort. They must be based on and tested by objective reality. Unless one makes the 
effort one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics.

Dialectical materialism holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the 
basis of change, and that external causes become operative through internal causes. In a suitable temperature 
an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken, because each has a different basis.

In approaching a problem a Marxist should see the whole as well as the parts. A frog in a well says, "The sky 
is no bigger than the mouth of the well." That is untrue, for the sky is not just the size of the mouth of the well. 
If it said, "A part of the sky is the size of the mouth of a well", that would be true, for it tallies with the facts.

If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing 
the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying 
any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal 
contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.
