The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society 
has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, 
new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; 
it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons:
the modern working class, the proletarians.

All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the 
interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, 
independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 
majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot 
stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of 
official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the 
bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, 
of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the 
antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, 
certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue 
its slavish existence.

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 

	1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they 
	point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, 
	independently of all nationality. 

	2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class 
	against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent 
	the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and 
resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which 
pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great 
mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, 
the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.

		-- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" (1848)

The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian 
parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois 
supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or 
principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be 
universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations 
springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going 
on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not 
at all a distinctive feature of communism.

		-- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" (1848)
%
The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, 
but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the 
final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, 
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: 
Abolition of private property.

We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally 
acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be 
the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, 
self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, 
a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; 
the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still 
destroying it daily.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all 
members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. 
It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.

In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. 
In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to 
promote the existence of the labourer.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person 
is dependent and has no individuality. And the abolition of this state of things is called 
by the bourgeois, "abolition of individuality and freedom"! And rightly so. The abolition of 
bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.

You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, 
private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the 
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, 
with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the 
non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.

In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. 
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.

Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to 
deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations.

It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal 
laziness will overtake us. According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs 
through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything 
do not work.

But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard 
of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, etc. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions 
of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class 
made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions 
of existence of your class.

The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the 
social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property – historical relations 
that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception you share with every ruling 
class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the 
case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.

The bourgeois sees his wife as a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production 
are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being 
common to all will likewise fall to the women.

He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere 
instruments of production.

In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation

In countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed, 
fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie, and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society. 
The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of 
competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear 
as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, 
bailiffs and shopmen.

A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence

temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind.

Q:	What is the proletariat?
A:	The proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and 
	does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose weal and woe, whose life and death, whose 
	sole existence depends on the demand for labor.

Q:	Proletarians, then, have not always existed?
A:	No. There have always been poor and working classes; and the working class have mostly been poor. 
	But there have not always been workers and poor people living under conditions as they are today; 
	in other words, there have not always been proletarians, any more than there has always been free 
	unbridled competitions.

Q:	How did the proletariat originate?
A: 	The Proletariat originated in the industrial revolution, which took place in England in the last half

[The] industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine, various spinning machines, 
the mechanical loom, and a whole series of other mechanical devices. These machines, which were very expensive 
and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former 
workers, because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with 
their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms. The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the 
big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers (tools, looms, etc). 
The result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers.

[...] Two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others. These are:

	1.	The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession 
		of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for 
		the production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or the bourgeoisie.

	2.	The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order 
		to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, 
		or the proletariat.

Q: 	In what way do proletarians differ from slaves?
A:	The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly.

The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery 
and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
Q:	In what way do proletarians differ from serfs?
A:	The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up 
	a part of his product or part of the services of his labor. The proletarian works with the instruments of 
	production of another, for the account of this other, in exchange for a part of the product.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
The serf liberates himself in one of three ways: either he runs away to the city and there becomes a 
handicraftsman; or, instead of products and services, he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a 
free tenant; or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner. In short, by one 
route or another, he gets into the owning class and enters into competition. The proletarian liberates 
himself by abolishing competition, private property, and all class differences.

We have come to the point where a new machine invented in England deprives millions of Chinese workers of their

Q:	Will the peaceful abolition of private property be possible?
A:	It would be desirable if this could happen, and the communists would certainly be the last to oppose it [...]
	But they also see that the development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has been violently 
	suppressed [...] we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them 
	with words.

%
Q:	Will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke?
A:	No [...] In all probability, the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and 
	will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity.

Q:	What will be [Communism's] attitude to existing religions?

	or groups of peoples. But communism is the stage of historical development which makes all existing 
	religions superfluous and brings about their disappearance.
