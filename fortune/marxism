All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the 
interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, 
independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 
majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot 
stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of 
official society being sprung into the air.

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 

	1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they 
	point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, 
	independently of all nationality. 

	2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class 
	against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent 
	the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and 
resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which 
pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great

the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or 
principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be 
universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations 
springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going 
on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not 
at all a distinctive feature of communism.

The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, 
but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the 
final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, 
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: 
Abolition of private property.

We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally 
acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be 
the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, 
self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, 
a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; 
the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still 
destroying it daily.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person

You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, 
private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the 
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, 
with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the 
non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.

In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. 
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.

It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal

do not work.

But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard

Q:	How did the proletariat originate?

[The] industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine, various spinning machines, 
the mechanical loom, and a whole series of other mechanical devices. These machines, which were very expensive 
and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former 
workers, because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with 
their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms. The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the 
big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers (tools, looms, etc). 
The result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers. 

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)

[...] Two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others. These are:

	1.	The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession 
		of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for 
		the production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or the bourgeoisie.

	2.	The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order 
		to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, 
		or the proletariat.

The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery 
and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
Q:	In what way do proletarians differ from serfs?
A:	The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up 
	a part of his product or part of the services of his labor. The proletarian works with the instruments of 
	production of another, for the account of this other, in exchange for a part of the product.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
The serf liberates himself in one of three ways: either he runs away to the city and there becomes a 
handicraftsman; or, instead of products and services, he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a 
free tenant; or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner. In short, by one 
route or another, he gets into the owning class and enters into competition. The proletarian liberates 
himself by abolishing competition, private property, and all class differences.

	suppressed [...] we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them 
	with words.

Q:	Will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke?

Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party and manifests 
itself in the process and the end-result of that party's actions. A revolutionary party is carrying 
out a policy whenever it takes any action. If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out 
a wrong policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing so blindly. What we call 
experience is the process and the end-result of carrying out a policy. Only through the practice of the 
people, that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and determine to 
what extent it is correct or wrong. However, people's practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary 
party and the revolutionary masses, cannot but be bound up with one policy or another. Therefore, before any 
action is taken, we must explain the policy, which we have formulated in the light of the given circumstances, 
to Party members and to the masses. Otherwise, Party members and the masses will depart from the guidance of 
our policy, act blindly and carry out a wrong policy.

succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our 
revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to uniting with our real friends in order to

the world according to its own world outlook, and so does the bourgeoisie. In this respect, the question of which

It will take a long period to decide the issue in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism 
in our country. The reason is that the influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals who come from 
the old society will remain in our country for a long time to come, and so will their class ideology. 
If this is not sufficiently understood, or is not understood at all, the gravest mistakes will be made 
and the necessity of waging the struggle in the ideological field will be ignored.

In our country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology will continue to exist for a 
long time. Basically, the socialist system has been established in our country. We have won the basic 
victory in transforming the ownership of the means of production, but we have not yet won complete victory 
on the political and ideological fronts. In the ideological field, the question of who will win in the 
struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet. We still have to 
wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology. It is wrong not to understand 
this and to give up ideological struggle. All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, 
must be subjected to criticism; in no circumstance should they be allowed to spread unchecked. However, 
the criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical and convincing, and not rough, bureaucratic, 
metaphysical or dogmatic.

Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism. Marxism must certainly advance; it must develop along 
with the development of practice and cannot stand still. It would become lifeless if it remained stagnant and 
stereotyped. However, the basic principles of Marxism must never be violated, or otherwise mistakes will be made. 
It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical point of view and to regard it as something rigid. 
It is revisionism to negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal truth. Revisionism is one 
form of bourgeois ideology. The revisionists deny the differences between socialism and capitalism, between the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. What they advocate is in fact not the 
socialist line but the capitalist line. In present circumstances, revisionism is more pernicious than dogmatism. 
One of our current important tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism.

Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is even more dangerous than dogmatism. 
The revisionists, the Right opportunists, pay lip service to Marxism; they too attack "dogmatism". However, 
what they are really attacking is the quintessence of Marxism. They oppose or distort materialism and dialectics, 
oppose or try to weaken the people's democratic dictatorship and the leading role of the Communist Party, and 
oppose or try to weaken socialist transformation and socialist construction. After the basic victory of the 
socialist revolution in our country, there are still a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist 
system and fight the working class on every front, including the ideological one. Moreover, their right-hand men 
in this struggle are the revisionists.

Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a new social system. It is different from any 
other ideological and social system, and is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary and rational system 
in human history. The ideological and social system of feudalism has a place only in the museum of history. 
The ideological and social system of capitalism has also become a museum piece in one part of the world 
(in the Soviet Union), while in other countries it resembles "a dying person who is sinking fast, like the sun 
setting beyond the western hills", and will soon be relegated to the museum. The communist ideological and 
social system alone is full of youth and vitality, sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche and the 
force of a thunderbolt.

Taken as a whole, the Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party embraces the two stages, 
i.e., the democratic and the socialist revolutions, which are two essentially different revolutionary processes, 
and the second process can be carried through only after the first has been completed. The democratic revolution 
is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable sequel 
to the democratic revolution. The ultimate aim for which all communists strive is to bring about a socialist and 
communist society.

Socialist revolution aims at liberating the productive forces. The changeover from individual to socialist, 
collective ownership in agriculture and handicrafts and from capitalist to socialist ownership in private 
industry and commerce is bound to bring about a tremendous liberation of the productive forces. Thus, the 
social conditions are being created for a tremendous expansion of industrial and agricultural production.

We are now carrying out a revolution not only in the social system, the change from private to public ownership, 
but also in technology, the change from handicraft to large-scale modern machine production, and the two revolutions 
are interconnected. In agriculture, with conditions as they are in our country co-operation must precede the use 
of big machinery (in capitalist countries agriculture develops in a capitalist way). Therefore we must on no account 
regard industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture as two 
separate and isolated things, and on no account must we emphasize the one and play down the other.

The new social system has only just been established and requires time for its consolidation. It must not be 
assumed that the new system can be completely consolidated the moment it is established, for that is impossible. 
It has to be consolidated systematically. To achieve its ultimate consolidation, it is necessary not only to bring 
about the socialist industrialization of the country and persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front, 
but also to carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political 
and ideological fronts. Moreover, various contributory international factors are required.

In China the struggle to consolidate the socialist system, the struggle to decide whether socialism or capitalism

The number of intellectuals who are hostile to our state is very small. They do not like our state, i.e., 
the dictatorship of the proletariat, and yearn for the old society. Whenever there is an opportunity, they 
will stir up trouble and attempt to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China. As between the 
proletarian and the bourgeois roads, as between the socialist and the capitalist roads, these people stubbornly 
choose to follow the latter. In fact, this road is impossible, and in fact, therefore, they are ready to 
capitulate to imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism. Such people are to be found in political

The leading bodies in co-operatives must establish the dominant position of the poor peasants and 
the new lower middle peasants in these bodies, with the old lower middle peasants and the upper middle 
peasants - whether old or new - as the supplementary force. Only thus can unity between the poor and 
middle peasants be attained. Moreover, the co-operatives can also be consolidated, production can be 
expanded and the socialist transformation of the entire countryside be correctly accomplished in 
accordance with the Party's policy. Otherwise, unity between the middle and poor peasants cannot be 
attained, the co-operatives cannot be consolidated, production cannot be expanded, and the socialist 
transformation of the entire countryside cannot be achieved.

It is essential to unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to do so. But on whom must 
the working class and the Communist Party rely in the countryside in order to unite with the middle 
peasants and realize the socialist transformation of the entire countryside? Surely on none other than 
the poor peasants. That was the case when the struggle against the landlords was being waged and the 
land reform was being carried out, and that is the case today when the struggle against the rich 
peasants and other capitalist elements is being waged to achieve the socialist transformation of 
agriculture. In both these revolutionary periods, the middle peasants wavered in the initial stages. 
It is only after they clearly see the general trend of events and the approaching triumph of the 
revolution that the middle peasants will come in on the side of the revolution. The poor peasants 
must work on the middle peasants and win them over, so that the revolution will broaden from day to 
day until final victory.

The agricultural co-operative movement has been a severe ideological and political struggle 
from the very beginning. No cooperative can be established without going through such a struggle. 
Before a brand-new social system can be built on the site of the old, the site must be swept clean. 
Invariably, remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system remain in people's minds for a long time, 
and they do not easily give way. After a co-operative is established, it must go through many more 
struggles before it can be consolidated. Even then, the moment it relaxes its efforts it may collapse.

The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, 
with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become 
rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient 
means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency 
goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. 
Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing 
nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do 
middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be 
able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant 
alliance continue to stand him in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this 
problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation 
of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization 
and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, 
it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy 
in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. 
We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

two basic contradictions will still exist in China. The first is internal, that is, the contradiction

Our state is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. 
What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress the reactionary classes and elements and those 
exploiters in our country who resist the socialist revolution, to suppress those who try to wreck our socialist 
construction, or in other words, to resolve the internal contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. 
For instance, to arrest, try and sentence certain counterrevolutionaries, and to deprive landlords and 
bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote and their freedom of speech for a specified period of time 
- all this comes within the scope of our dictatorship. To maintain public order and safeguard the interests 
of the people, it is likewise necessary to exercise dictatorship over embezzlers, swindlers, arsonists, murderers, 
criminal gangs and other scoundrels who seriously disrupt public order. The second function of this dictatorship 
is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression by external enemies. In that event, it is the 
task of this dictatorship to resolve the external contradiction between the enemy and us. The aim of this dictatorship 
is to protect all our people so that they can devote themselves to peaceful labour and build China into a socialist 
country with a modern industry, agriculture, science and culture.

The People's democratic dictatorship is based on the alliance of the working class, the peasantry and the urban

Kuomintang reactionaries. The transition from New Democracy to socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance.

Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements 
for building a mighty socialist country. These movements are a sure guarantee that Communists will be free from 
bureaucracy and immune against revisionism and dogmatism, and will forever remain invincible. They are a reliable 
guarantee that the proletariat will be able to unite with the broad working masses and realize a democratic dictatorship. 
If, in the absence of these movements, the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements and monsters 
were all allowed to crawl out, while our cadres were to shut their eyes to all this and in many cases fail even to 
differentiate between the enemy and ourselves but were to collaborate with the enemy and were corrupted, divided and 
demoralized by him, if our cadres were thus pulled out or the enemy were able to sneak in, and if many of our 
workers, peasants, and intellectuals were left defenseless against both the soft and the hard tactics of the enemy, 
then it would not take long, perhaps only several years or a decade, or several decades at most, before a 
counterrevolutionary restoration on a national scale inevitably occurred, the Marxist-Leninist party would undoubtedly

The People's democratic dictatorship uses two methods. Towards the enemy, it uses the method of dictatorship, 
that is, for as long a period of time as is necessary it does not let them take part in political activities and 
compels them to obey the law of the People's Government and to engage in labour and, through labour, transform 
themselves into new men. Towards the people, on the contrary, it uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy, 
that is, it must necessarily let them take part in political activities and does not compel them to do this or that, 
but uses the method of democracy in educating and persuading them.

On the basis of the principles of our Constitution, the will of the overwhelming majority of our people and the 
common political positions which have been proclaimed on various occasions by our political parties and groups, 
we consider that, broadly speaking, the criteria should be as follows:

	1. 	Words and actions should help to unite, and not divide, the people of our various nationalities.

	2. 	They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation and socialist construction.

	3. 	They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's democratic dictatorship.

right and wrong. It is, of course, true that the distinction between the enemy and us is also a matter of 
right and wrong. For example, the question of who is in the right, we or the domestic and foreign reactionaries,

The only way to settle questions of an ideological nature or controversial issues among the people is by the 
democratic method, the method of discussion, of criticism, of persuasion and education, and not by the method 
of coercion or repression. To be able to carry on their production and studies effectively and to arrange their 
lives properly, the people want their government and those in charge of production and of cultural and educational 
organizations to issue appropriate orders of an obligatory nature. It is common sense that the maintenance of 
public order would be impossible without such administrative regulations. Administrative orders and the method of 
persuasion and education complement each other in resolving contradictions among the people. Even administrative

In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie belongs to the 
category of contradictions among the people. Largely, the class struggle between the two is a class struggle 
within the ranks of the people, because the Chinese national bourgeoisie has a dual character. In the period of 
the bourgeois-democratic revolution, it had both a revolutionary and a conciliationist side to its character. 
In the period of the socialist revolution, exploitation of the working class for profit constitutes one side of 
the character of the national bourgeoisie, while its support of the Constitution and its willingness to accept 
socialist transformation constitute the other. The national bourgeoisie differs from the imperialists, 
the landlords and the bureaucrat-capitalists. The contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the 
working class is one between the exploiter and the exploited, and is by nature antagonistic. Nevertheless, 
in the concrete conditions of China, this antagonistic class contradiction can, if properly handled, 
be transformed into a non-antagonistic one and be resolved by peaceful methods. However, it will change into a 
contradiction between ourselves and the enemy if we do not handle it properly and do not follow the policy of 
uniting with, criticizing and educating the national bourgeoisie, or if the national bourgeoisie does not accept 
this policy of ours.

[The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956] was a case of reactionaries inside a socialist country, 
in league with the imperialists, attempting to achieve their conspiratorial aims by taking advantage of contradictions 
among the people to foment dissension and stir up disorder. This lesson of the Hungarian events merits attention.

War is the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions, when they have developed to a certain stage, 
between classes, nations, states, or political groups, and it has existed ever since the emergence of private property 
and of classes.

"War is the continuation of politics." In this sense, war is politics and war itself is a political action; 
since ancient times there has never been a war that did not have a political character.... However, war has 
its own particular characteristics and in this sense, it cannot be equated with politics in general. 
"War is the continuation of politics by other means." When politics develops to a certain stage beyond which 
it cannot proceed by the usual means, war breaks out to sweep the obstacles from the way.... When the obstacle 
is removed and our political aim attained the war will stop. Nevertheless, if the obstacle is not completely 
swept away, the war will have to continue until the aim is fully accomplished.... It can therefore be said that 
politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed.

History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust. All wars that are progressive are just, 
and all wars that impede progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, 
but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars; we actively 
participate in them. As for unjust wars, [World War One] is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist 
interests; therefore, the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war. The way to oppose a war of this 
kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, 
to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible.

Revolutions and revolutionary wars are inevitable in class society, and without them it is impossible 
to accomplish any leap in social development and to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes and therefore 
impossible for the people to win political power.

Revolutionary war is an antitoxin that not only eliminates the enemy's poison but also purges 
us of our own filth. Every just, revolutionary war is endowed with tremendous power and can 
transform many things or clear the way for their transformation. The Sino-Japanese war will 
transform both China and Japan; provided China perseveres in the War of Resistance and in 
the united front, the old Japan will surely be transformed into a new Japan and the old China 
into a new China, and people and everything else in both China and Japan will be transformed 
during and after the war.

The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the 
highest form of revolution. This Marxist-Leninist principle of revolution holds well universally, 
for China and for all other countries.

Without armed struggle neither the proletariat, nor the people, nor the Communist Party would have 
any standing at all in China and it would be impossible for the revolution to triumph. In these years 
[the eighteen years since the founding of the Party] the development, consolidation and bolshevization 
of our Party have proceeded in the midst of revolutionary wars; without armed struggle the Communist Party 
would assuredly not be what it is today. Comrades throughout the Party must never forget this experience 
for which we have paid in blood.

According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power. 
Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army. Some people ridicule us as 
advocates of the "omnipotence of war". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; 
that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. 
We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism 
teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the laboring masses can 
defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the 
whole world be transformed.

We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war,

War, this monster of mutual slaughter among men, will be finally eliminated by the progress of human society, 
and in the not too distant future too. But there is only one way to eliminate it and that is to oppose 
war with war, to oppose counterrevolutionary war with revolutionary war, to oppose national counter-revolutionary 
war with national revolutionary war, and to oppose counter-revolutionary class war with revolutionary class war.... 
When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars, 
counter-revolutionary or revolutionary, unjust or just; that will be the era of perpetual peace for mankind. 
Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the desire to eliminate all wars. Herein, lies the 
distinction between us Communists and all the exploiting classes.

To achieve a lasting world peace, we must further develop our friendship and co-operation with the fraternal countries 
in the socialist camp and strengthen our solidarity with all peace-loving countries. We must endeavor to establish 
normal diplomatic relations, based on mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and of equality and 
mutual benefit, with all countries willing to live together with us in peace. We must give active support to the 
national independence and liberation movement in countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America as well as to the 
peace movement and to just struggles in all the countries of the world.

As for the imperialist countries, we should unite with their peoples and strive to coexist peacefully with

We desire peace. However, if imperialism insists on fighting a war, we will have no alternative but to 
take the firm resolution to fight to the finish before going ahead with our construction. If you are afraid 
of war day in day out, what will you do if war eventually comes? First, I said that the East Wind is prevailing 
over the West Wind and war will not break out, and now I have added these explanations about the situation in 
case war should break out. Both possibilities have thus been taken into account.

People all over the world are now discussing whether a third world war will break out. On this question, too, 
we must be mentally prepared and do some analysis. We stand firmly for peace and against war. However, if the 
imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be afraid of it. Our attitude on this question 
is the same as our attitude towards any disturbance: first, we are against it; second, we are not afraid of it. 
The First World War was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million. 
The Second World War was followed by the emergence of the socialist camp with a combined population of 900 million. 
If the imperialists insist on launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred million more will turn 
to socialism, and then there will not be much room left on earth for the imperialists; it is also likely that the 
whole structure of imperialism will utterly collapse.

Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again.... until their doom- that is the logic of the imperialists and 
all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause and they will never go against this logic. 
This is a Marxist law. When we say "imperialism is ferocious", we mean that its nature will never change, 
that the imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, that they will never become Buddhas, till their doom. 
Fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again.... until their victory; that is the logic of the people,
 and they too will never go against this logic. This is another Marxist law. The Russian people's revolution 
 followed this law, and so has the Chinese people's revolution.

The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not resign themselves to defeat in 
this land of China. They will continue to gang up against the Chinese people in every possible way. For example, 
they will smuggle their agents into China to sow dissension and make trouble. That is certain; they will never 
neglect these activities. To take another example, the imperialists will incite the Chinese reactionaries, and 
even throw in their own forces, to blockade China's ports. They will do this as long as it is possible. Furthermore, 
if they still hanker after adventures, they will send some of their troops to invade and harass frontiers of China; 
this, too, is not impossible. All this we must take fully into account.
