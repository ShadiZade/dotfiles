All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the 
interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, 
independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 
majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot 
stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of 
official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 

1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they 
point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, 
independently of all nationality. 

2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class 
against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent 
the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and 
resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which 
pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great 
mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, 
the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or 
principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be 
universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations 
springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going 
on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not 
at all a distinctive feature of communism.

The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, 
but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the 
final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, 
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: 
Abolition of private property.

We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally 
acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be 
the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, 
self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, 
a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; 
the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still 
destroying it daily.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person

You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, 
private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the 
few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, 
with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the 
non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.

In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. 
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.

It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal

competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear

Q:	Proletarians, then, have not always existed?

unbridled competitions.

Q:	How did the proletariat originate?

A: 	The Proletariat originated in the industrial revolution, which took place in England in the last half

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)

[The] industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine, various spinning machines, 
the mechanical loom, and a whole series of other mechanical devices. These machines, which were very expensive 
and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former 
workers, because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with 
their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms. The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the 
big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers (tools, looms, etc). 
The result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers. 

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
[...] Two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others. These are:

1.	The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession 
of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for 
the production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or the bourgeoisie.

2.	The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order 
to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, 
or the proletariat.

The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery 
and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
Q:	In what way do proletarians differ from serfs?

A:	The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up 
a part of his product or part of the services of his labor. The proletarian works with the instruments of 
production of another, for the account of this other, in exchange for a part of the product.

		-- Friedrich Engels, "The Principles of Communism" (1847)
%
The serf liberates himself in one of three ways: either he runs away to the city and there becomes a 
handicraftsman; or, instead of products and services, he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a 
free tenant; or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner. In short, by one 
route or another, he gets into the owning class and enters into competition. The proletarian liberates 
himself by abolishing competition, private property, and all class differences.

suppressed [...] we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them 
with words.

Q:	Will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke?

will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity.

national revolutionary war; the contradiction between the working class and the peasant class in socialist 
society is resolved by the method of collectivization and mechanization in agriculture; contradiction within 
the Communist Party is resolved by the method of criticism and self-criticism; the contradiction between 
society and nature is resolved by the method of developing the productive forces. The principle of using 
different methods to resolve different contradictions is one that Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe.

We are Marxists, and Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective facts,

Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they 
like without basing it on objective reality or having it tested against reality. Materialism and dialectics, 
on the other hand, need effort. They must be based on and tested by objective reality. Unless one makes the 
effort one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics.

Dialectical materialism holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the

In approaching a problem a Marxist should see the whole as well as the parts. A frog in a well says, "The sky

If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing 
the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying 
any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal 
contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.

You can’t solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the present facts and its past history! When you have 
investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it. Conclusions invariably come after investigation, 
and not before. Only a blockhead cudgels his brains on his own, or together with a group, to "find a solution" or 
"evolve an idea" without making any investigation. It must be stressed that this cannot possibly lead to any effective 
solution or any good idea.

Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to shoulder it. Some loads are light, some heavy. Some people

At the children’s theaters [in the USSR] the children are expected not only to be spectators but to criticize the 
performances and to make suggestions for their improvement. The Moscow children’s theaters arrange meetings between

But the necessity of authority, and of imperious authority at that, will nowhere be found more evident than on board a

When I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians, the only answer they were able to give me 
was the following: Yes, that’s true, but there it is not the case of authority which we confer on our delegates, but of 
a commission entrusted! These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the 
things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.

Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All Socialists 
are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social 
revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple 
administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society.

A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes

Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don’t know what they’re talking about, in which case

Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich

The imperialists have always looked upon the East as the basis of their prosperity. Have not the inestimable natural 
resources (cotton, oil, gold, coal, ores) of the East been an "apple of discord" between the imperialists of all

It is the task of communism to break the age-long sleep of the oppressed peoples of the East, to infect the workers and
