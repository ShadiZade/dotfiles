# dotfiles
These are the dotfiles (configuration files) of ShadiZade.
Here's a brief explanation of each one:

- **awesome**: A lua-based tiling window manager. This repo contains the config file as well as the theme file.
- **bspwm**: A minimalist tiling window manager. My favorite at the moment.
- **emacs**: A [thermonuclear text editor]("https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/resources/Carolen Notes/using_unix.html") with an [insane learning curve](https://external-preview.redd.it/wEjRcWYAFCeUWUvDnmmM0hJ1MYgD2YvWLNHJTJip8xs.png?auto=webp&s=31c816e5c3f743922b6d457fbb521ef910e67c8a). It's part of the adventure, I promise.
- **fortune**: An insiprational-quote-fetching program for the command line. It comes pre-loaded with smartass edgy quotes, but I have some other quotes to add.
- **kitty**: A simple and fast terminal emulator.
- **picom**: A compositor for X11. It's what makes stuff transparent. 
- **polybar**: The thingy on the top of the screen. You need it for bspwm.
- **rofi**: I mostly use it for the `rofi -show drun` functionality.
- **sxhkd**: Winner of the [second worst](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) name in the open source world, It's actually pretty good at managing keybindings.
- **xkb**: Having borked my keyboard on more than one occasion, my custom keyboard layouts for Arabic and English are here, just in case.
- **zsh**: Shell for Linux, yadda yadda, you get the picture.
